        <h4 class="section-header">What's the dress code?</h4>
        <div class="section-item"><p>Wear something that makes you feel fancy and comfortable! If you’re looking for an official dress code, “cocktail” is probably the right idea, but wear something you’re excited to wear. A suit, a long dress, a fun buttondown, a cocktail dress, bright colors and patterns - we’ll love it all!</p>
        <p>The weather in Piedmont in mid-November will likely be in the mid 50s to low 60s, so we recommend bringing a coat (the ceremony & cocktail hour will be outside).</p>

        <h4 class="section-header">Should I bring a gift?</h4>
        <div class="section-item">We don't need or expect that you bring anything but yourself. We love you and your presence is a gift to us! We know some folks may want to get us something, and we'll update here when we have more information about the best way to do that! </div>
        <h4 class="section-header">Can I RSVP?</h4>
        <div class="section-item">We'll send out official invites in a few months with a link to an RSVP form, so no need for now. However, if you already know you won't be able to make it, we'd appreciate if you let us know!
        <h4 class="section-header">I have another question</h4>
        <div class="section-item">Feel free to reach out directly with any questions you have! We'll also update this site with lots more details as the date gets closer.</div>
