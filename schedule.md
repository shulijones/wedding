            <p><strong>Saturday, November 14th: Wedding!</strong> The ceremony will start around 3:45 or 4 pm; afterwards, dinner will be served followed by dancing. More details to come :)</p>
            <p> We’re also planning to have some optional events before and after the wedding, so that we can spend more time with folks. The exact schedule is still TBD, but a rough sense:</p>
                <p><strong>Thursday and Friday, November 12-13th</strong>: We'll likely have some optional activities like a picnic in the park or going to a museum. All are welcome but no pressure to come!</p>
                <p><strong>Sunday, November 15th</strong>: We’ll host a day-after brunch; time and place TBD, but somewhere in San Francisco.</p>
