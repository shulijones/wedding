            <br>
            <p> We’re also planning to have some optional events before and after the wedding, so that we can spend more time with folks. The exact schedule is still TBD, but a rough sense:</p>
                <p><span class="date">Thursday and Friday, November 12-13th:</span><br>We'll likely have some optional activities like a picnic in the park or going to a museum. All are welcome but no pressure to come!</p>
                <p><span class="date">Sunday, November 15th:</span><br>We’ll host a day-after brunch; time and place TBD, but somewhere in San Francisco.</p>
