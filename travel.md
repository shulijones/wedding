        <div class="section-item">
        If you're traveling, we'd recommend flying into either San Francisco International Airport (SFO) or Oakland Airport (OAK). Both are reasonably convenient to the wedding venue location of Piedmont and to the city of San Francisco where we live. You can book a rental car if you'd like, but it's not necessary - both airports are connected to the BART subway system and the area has plenty of public transportation (plus, parking can often be tricky in the city).

        <h4 class="section-header">Where to stay</h4>
        <div class="section-item">
        <p>We live in the southeast part of San Francisco's Mission District (24th & Bryant). The wedding itself will be in Piedmont, across the Bay to the east of SF. Other wedding events will likely be sprinkled throughout SF.</p>
        <p>If you’re only in town for a short time, you may want to get a hotel in Piedmont or the neighboring city of Oakland; this will be closer to the venue but further from us in SF. If you'll be here for a little longer and want to come to attend some of the optional events before/after the wedding (or do some sightseeing), we recommend staying in San Francisco. Most hotels are downtown; if you pick one that's close to a BART stop, you'll be able to easily move around the city. BART also goes across the water to the East Bay, just a short bus ride from the wedding venue.</p>
