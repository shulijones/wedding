        <p>We live in the southeast part of San Francisco's Mission District (24th & Bryant). The wedding itself will be in Piedmont, across the Bay to the east of SF. Other wedding events will likely be sprinkled throughout SF.</p>
        <p>If you’re only in town for a short time, you may want to get a hotel in Piedmont or the neighboring city of Oakland; this will be closer to the venue but further from us in SF. If you'll be here for a little longer and want to come to attend some of the optional events before/after the wedding (or do some sightseeing), we recommend staying in San Francisco. Most hotels are downtown; if you pick one that's close to a BART stop, you'll be able to easily move around the city. BART also goes across the water to the East Bay, just a short bus ride from the wedding venue.</p>
